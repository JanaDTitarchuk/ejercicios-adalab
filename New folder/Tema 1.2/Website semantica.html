    <h1>Programming languages and skills to become a Front End developer</h1>
    <h2>What is Front End Development?</h2>
        <p>While web design is the way a website looks, front end development is how that design actually gets implemented on the web.</p>
    <h2>And, what is a Front End Developer?</h2>
        <p>
        A front end web developer is the person who implements web designs through coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though it’s not as common anymore, front end developers are/were sometimes called “client-side developers” to distinguish them from back end developers who program what goes on behind the scenes (like databases). If you head to any site, you can see the work of a front end developer everywhere—in the navigation, layouts including this article page, even the way that a site looks different from your phone (thanks to mobile-first or responsive design).
        </p>
        <p>Now that we’ve got that out of the way, this article will break down some of the key skills front end web developers use on the job:</p>
    <h3>Java Script</h3>
        <p>JavaScript lets you add a ton more functionality to your websites, and you can create a lot of basic web applications using nothing more than HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS for short). On the most basic level, JS is used to create and control things like maps that update in real time, interactive films, and online games. Sites like Pinterest use JavaScript heavily to make their user interface easy to use (the fact that the page doesn’t reload whenever you pin something is thanks to JavaScript!).

            It’s also the most popular programming language in the world, so regardless of your dev career plans, it’s a super valuable thing to learn.</p>
    <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>      
        <p>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the most basic building blocks of web coding. Without these two things, you can’t create a website design, and all you’ll end up with is unformatted plain text on the screen. You can’t even add images to a page without HTML!

        Before you get started on any web development career path, you’ll have to master coding with HTML and CSS. The good news is that getting a solid working knowledge of either of these can be done in just a few weeks.
        
        The best part: HTML and CSS knowledge alone will let you build basic websites.</p>
    <h3>jQuery</h3>
        <p>jQuery is a JavaScript library: a collection of plugins and extensions that makes developing with JavaScript faster and easier. Rather than having to code everything from scratch, jQuery lets a front end web developer add ready-made elements to projects, then customize as necessary (one reason why knowing JavaScript is so important). You can use jQuery for things like countdown timers, search form autocomplete, and even automatically-rearranging and resizing grid layouts.</p>
    <h3>JavaScript Frameworks</h3>
        <p>JS frameworks (including AngularJS, Backbone, Ember, and ReactJS) give a ready-made structure to your JavaScript code. There are different types of JavaScript frameworks for different needs, though the four mentioned are the most popular in actual job listings. These frameworks really speed up development by giving you a jumpstart, and can be used with libraries like jQuery to minimize how much from-scratch coding you have to do.</p>
